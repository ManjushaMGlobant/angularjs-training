1. Separate out the styles in css file, instead of inline styles in HTML.

2. Only a single script file contains all the JS code

3. Use ng-if where exclusive display of DOM is needed, instead of ng-hide and ng-show

4. Name the parameters appropriately. For eg. "choice" does not give a clear idea on what choice means in the context.

5. Remove unnecessary redundancy in the code. You have called ExpenseService.calculateBalance api after every add/update/delete transaction. But, this can be done in the service itself, implicitly. The controller need not have to remember to calculate Balance every time.

6. Use angular broadcast events, in case if different modules(i.e. controllers/services ) depend on updates in data managed by other service/controller.

7. Show success as well as error messages. 

8. There should always be a user re-confirmation before removing/deleting data.

9. Show help on hovering action icons like View/Edit/Delete
